# Learn Jupyter

This repository contains notebooks to getting started and familiar with [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## Prerequisites

- Install Git -- [see here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/set-up-git).
- Install Python, preferably Python 3 -- [see here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Install Jupyter, preferably using Pip -- [see here](https://jupyter.org/install).

## Getting Started

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/airlab-unsri/learn-jupyter.git
```

Go to the newly created directory:

cd learn-jupyter
```

Run Jupyter server:

```

You will see these logs about notebook server on your terminal:

```bash
[I 19:35:22.651 NotebookApp] Serving notebooks from local directory: /Users/ariefrahmansyah/go/src/github.com/airlab-unsri/learn-jupyter
[I 19:35:22.652 NotebookApp] The Jupyter Notebook is running at:
